  dialogue:
  - Ah... Are you hear the words of our mother, brother?
  - The time has finally come! Soon we will avenge ourselves on the treacherous king,
    Garland the Dark.
  - But first, it would be a good idea to brush up on our skills, right? Later on,
    you can take on the empty shells left by our brethren.
  - Give them the peace they deserve and show us what you can do. Do you remember
    how to attack, right?
