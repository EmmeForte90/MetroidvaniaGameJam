  dialogue:
  - Umpf, not bad brother. Not bad indeed. You know? However, don't let it get to
    your head, you're not the only one to whom our mother has entrusted THE task.
  - Anyway, you're strong, I'll give you that. But be careful because our brother
    Enard has taken guard at the door and is not letting anyone out. He's really
    hot-headed.
  - He even closed the gate that leads to the sanctuary's atrium. If someone could
    reason with him...
  - Do you want to give it a try?
